## Installation
This section guides you to install all required software and libraries to utilize **Shapen Angular** for your projects fully.

### Node
Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript run time built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is required to build the **Shapen Angular**. Download the latest version of Node and install it: Download [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### NPM
NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the world‚Äôs largest software registry. NPM is a separate project from Node.js and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if you‚Äôve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), you‚Äôll probably need to update your NPM .

```
npm install --global npm@latest
```

Verify that npm in successfully installed, and version of installed npm will appear
```
npm --version
```

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
